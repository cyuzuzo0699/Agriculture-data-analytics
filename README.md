# Agriculture-data-analytics
This repository contains the Python scripts and analysis developed as part of my Master's thesis at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Rwanda.  
The project focuses on analyzing agricultural and environmental data collected through Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and compares the performance of **BLE** and **ESP-NOW** wireless communication protocols.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following environmental and communication performance measurements:

- Temperature (Â°C):
Measures the ambient air temperature at the sensor node.

- Humidity (%):
Represents the percentage of water vapor in the air, affecting plant transpiration and evaporation.

- Soil Moisture (%):
Indicates the volumetric water content in the soil, critical for irrigation planning.

- Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI):
Reflects the quality of the wireless signal received by the sensor node, typically measured in dBm. Useful for evaluating the performance of communication protocols like BLE or ESP-NOW.
