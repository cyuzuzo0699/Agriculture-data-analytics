# Agriculture-data-analytics
This repository contains the Python scripts and analysis developed as part of my Master's thesis at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).  
The project focuses on analyzing agricultural and environmental data collected through Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and compares the performance of **BLE** and **ESP-NOW** wireless communication protocols.
